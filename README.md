# Escampe Minimax AI

A Java implementation of an intelligent agent for the strategic board game **Escampe**, featuring a custom AI player with board state tracking, legal move generation, and decision-making algorithms based on the **Minimax** algorithm.

## üéØ Project Objective

The goal of this project is to develop an AI capable of playing Escampe efficiently by analyzing the current game state, generating legal moves, and selecting optimal strategies using a minimax-based decision engine. This agent simulates intelligent behavior to challenge human or AI opponents in a turn-based board setting.

## üß† Key Features

- **Board Representation**: Encodes the full state of the Escampe board at any point during the game.
- **Legal Move Generation**: Dynamically computes all valid moves for each player according to the game's rules.
- **Minimax Algorithm**: Implements the Minimax decision-making algorithm to evaluate the best move based on simulated outcomes.
- **Custom Evaluation Function**: Assesses board states to guide the Minimax algorithm in choosing strategic moves.
- **Modular Design**: Clean architecture to separate game logic, AI behavior, and utilities.

## üïπÔ∏è Game Overview: Escampe

Escampe is a two-player strategic game involving a hidden target mechanic. Each player aims to deduce and capture the opponent's "target" piece while protecting their own. This adds a layer of hidden information and inference to traditional board gameplay, making AI development both challenging and engaging.
